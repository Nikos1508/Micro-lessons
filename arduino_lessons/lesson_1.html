            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p> Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - 
                light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, 
                publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. 
                To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing. </p>

            <h3>Arduino Board and Components:</h3>
            <p>An arduino consists of 5 main parts.
            <ol>
                <li>The power supply, which consists of 2 receptacles of 5 and 12 volts respectively.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The digital pins with which we transfer commands to the various components of our construction, such as sensors and motors.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Analog pins which have a similar function to the digital pins with the difference that they transfer data from the arduino to the components and also from the components to the arduino at frequent intervals. This allows us to control screens, machines, etc</li>
                <br>
                <li>Power, there are receptacles for grounding, 5 and 3.3 volts as well as pins to control when each component will receive power, for how long or if a reset should be done on the arduino or in some other part of our storage.</li>
                <br>
                <li>ICSP (secondary controls) These pins are used to code and boot an Arduino from an external source. These pins allow inter workings of two or more Arduino boards and also allow you to upload your firmware.</li>
            </ol>
