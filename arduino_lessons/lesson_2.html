        <div id="lesson"><h2>Resistors</h2>
            <p>When building your Arduino projects, you use resistors to limit the amount of current going to certain components in the circuit, 
            such as LEDs and integrated circuits. To calculate the resistance, you should use a modified version of Ohm’s Law. In the following 
            equation, R is resistance; <b>V</b><sub>provided</sub> is the voltage supplied from the power source (this is 5V for a standard Arduino digital pin, but 
            could be more or less if the <b>V</b><sub>in</sub> pin is used); <b>V</b><sub>needed</sub> is the voltage required by the component, and I is the current required 
            by the component:
            <br><br>
            R = (Vprovided - Vneeded) / I
            <br><br>
            Here is an example for powering an LED:
            <br><br>
            (5V – 2V) / 0.03A = 100Ω
            <br><br>
            After you’ve determined which resistor you need, the next task is to find it. Fixed-value resistors use colored bands to 
            indicate the value of the resistor. To find the value you can use a multimeter on the ohms (Ω) setting, but if you don’t have 
            a multimeter handy, use the following table to find the value instead. For example, a resistor with brown, black, brown, and 
            gold bands is a 100Ω resistor with a 5% tolerance.

            <h2>LEDs</h2>
            <p>A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the 
                semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light (corresponding 
                to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The long pin(leg) of the LED is the anode (positive +) and the short pin(leg) is the cothode (negative -). In order to connect 
                LED's in and Arduinohe former will be connected in the 5V and the latter in the GND. In between (arduino and negative pin) you have
                to add a resistor with 220Ω(ohm).
            </p>

            <h2>Buttons</h2>
            <p>
                When the pushbutton is open (unpressed) there is no connection between the two legs of the pushbutton, so the pin is connected to 
                ground (through the pull-down resistor) and we read a LOW. When the button is closed (pressed), it makes a connection between its 
                two legs, connecting the pin to 5 volts, so that we read a HIGH.
            </p>

            <h2>Jumber wires</h2>
            <p>
                As you will see later, you need jumper wires in order to connect sensors, breadboards, arduino and other things.
                <br> There are 3 different kinds of jumper wires: Male-Male (1st image), Male-Female (2nd image) and Female to female (3rd image).
                <br> Male to Male wires are used when you want to connectthe breadboard with your arduino.
                <br> Male to Female wires are mostly used as connectors between a sensor and the breadboard or the arduino if you don't connect 
                it in the breadboard (e.g. You want to connect an LCD screen in the arduino itself without using the breadboard at all.)
                <br> Female to Female wires are the least used wires and they only used if you want to connect something in the ICSP 
                (In-Circuit Serial Programming) or connect two Male to Male wires to each other in order to make a wire longer.

            <h2>Breadboards</h2>
            <p>
                A breadboard is a solderless construction base used for developing an electronic circuit and wiring for projects with 
                microcontroller boards like Arduino. As common as it seems, it may be daunting when first getting started with using one.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to connect something into the breadboard you have to use jumper wires (in the 1st image).
