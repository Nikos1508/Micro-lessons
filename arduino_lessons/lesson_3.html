            <p>In the world of electronics, information comes in two main flavors: analog and digital. 
                Understanding these differences is crucial for working with Arduino and its various components.</p>
                <h2>Analog Signals</h2>
                <p>Imagine a dimmer switch for a light bulb. As you turn the knob, the brightness changes smoothly - 
                    there are infinite possibilities between completely off and fully lit. This continuous variation represents 
                    an analog signal.Think of it like a dial with countless positions. Used to represent real-world phenomena 
                    like temperature, sound, or light intensity.</p>
                <h2>Digital Signals</h2>
                <p>Now imagine a light switch. It's either on (high voltage) or off (low voltage). 
                    These two distinct states represent a digital signal.Think of it like a light 
                    switch with only two positions: ON and OFF. Used to control electronic devices 
                    like LEDs, motors, or relays.</p>
                <h2>Reading Analog Input with Sensors</h2>
                <p>
                    The Arduino excels at interacting with both worlds. Sensors are devices that convert physical 
                    quantities (like temperature or light) into electrical signals. But most sensors output analog signals. 
                    Here's how Arduino bridges the gap:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC): <br> This built-in circuit within the Arduino takes an analog voltage and converts it into a digital number. The range of this number usually goes from 0 (representing 0 volts) to 1023 (representing the maximum voltage, typically 5 volts on Arduino Uno). </p></li>
                    <li><p>Reading Analog Input: <br> We use the analogRead(pin) function in Arduino code. This function takes a pin number (where the sensor is connected) and returns the digital value representing the voltage read from the sensor. </p></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Mini-project (Reading Light with an LDR)</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's build a circuit to measure light intensity using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). LDRs change resistance based on the amount of light they receive. Here's what you'll need:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arduino Uno</li>
                        <li>Breadboard</li>
                        <li>Jumper wires</li>
                        <li>LDR</li>
                        <li>100 ohm resistor</li>
                        <li>LED</li>
                    </ul>
                    Code:
                    <br>
                    int sensorPin = A0; // LDR connected to analog pin 0<br>
                    int ledPin = 13;    // LED connected to digital pin 13<br>
                    <br>
                    void setup() {<br>
                      pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // Set LED pin as output<br>
                    }<br>
                    <br>
                    void loop() {<br>
                      int sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); // Read analog value from LDR<br>
                      int brightness = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255); // Map analog value to LED brightness (0-255)<br>
                      analogWrite(ledPin, brightness); // Control LED brightness based on sensor reading<br>
                      delay(100); // Delay for stability<br>
                    }<br>
                    <h3>Explanation:</h3>
                    <p>
                    We define pins for the LDR (analog) and LED (digital).<br>
                    In setup(), we set the LED pin as output.<br>
                    Inside the loop(), we read the analog value from the LDR using analogRead(sensorPin).<br>
                    The map() function converts the analog value (0-1023) to a brightness value (0-255) suitable for controlling the LED.<br>
                    analogWrite(ledPin, brightness) controls the LED brightness based on the sensor reading (brighter with more light).<br>
                    A small delay (delay(100)) ensures smooth operation.</p>
